# opsdroid-repohook

Route Git{Hub|Lab}-Events to a chatroom via opsdroid. 

This repo contains a bodged-together code-copy from https://github.com/mayflower/err-githubhook/tree/0ec039eda324d06fb3cc35eb2f52b5df9105feeb - which itself is a fork of https://github.com/daenney/err-repohook, extending that to support both Github *and* Gitlab events.
The 'bodge' is why you'll find a lot of inefficient and inconsistent code. Sorry.
